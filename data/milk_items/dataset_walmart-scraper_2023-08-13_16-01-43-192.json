The representative I spoke with knew nothing about the product other than what I could already read from the label. She had a poor attitude towards me and also toward my question. I would think a company that markets its products as 'health' conscious alternatives would welcome questions from the consumer about nutrient values.",

That is really upsetting to me because Silk almond milk is one of my main sources of calcium. The old formula had 45% of daily calcium needs per serving while the new formula only has 30%. The old one had 25% of vitamen D needs and the new has only 10%. This is a big difference in nutritional value! (I have atraxhef a picture - new formula in the right and old formula in the left). Please bring back the old formula!!",
